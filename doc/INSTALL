BlendCalendar installation instructions

Requirements
============

   * eZ Publish 4.3+

Installation
============

1. Unpack/unzip

  Unpack the downloaded package into the 'extension' directory of your eZ Publish installation.

2. Create SQL tables in your eZ Publish database

   This extension requires an additional table to be added to your database, BlendEvent.
   Use the following command from your eZ Publish
   root folder, replacing "user", "password", "host" and "database" with correct values and removing double quotes

   mysql -u "user" -p"password" -h"host" "database" < extension/blendcalendar/sql/mysql/schema.sql

3. Activate extension

   Activate the extension by prepending blendcalendar to ActiveExtensions[] 
   in settings/override/site.ini.append.php:

   [ExtensionSettings]
   ActiveExtensions[]=blendcalendar

   Be sure to place the blendcalendar entry before the ezwebin entry in order 
   to have access to the BlendCalendar templates

4. Regenerate autoload array

   Run the following from your eZ Publish root folder

   php bin/php/ezpgenerateautoloads.php --extension

   Or go to Setup -> Extensions and click the "Regenerate autoload arrays" button

5. Create Event and Calendar Class Types

   In order for the calendar to work, you'll need at least one class that has an attribute
   with the 'Blend Calendar Event' data type. You can create a new class with this, 
   or modify an existing class. Note that the data type will store both date and time.
   
   If you wish to use the provided AJAX-based calendar editing controls, you will also need
   a container class type to serve as a calendar. This can be any sort of class as long as it's 
   a container.
   
   In the eZ Admin, go to Setup -> Classes, and configure classes to serve as Event and Calendar
   classes. Make sure to add the Blend Calendar Event data type to the Event class. Make a note of the
   class attribute ID created for the Blend Calendar Event data type - you'll need it for the next step.

6. Configure Settings

   The AJAX calendar editing controls currently only function for a single Event class, and rely on 
   settings in content.ini. These will need to be customized for your install.
   
   Customize or override the settings in blendcalendar/settings/content.ini.append.php to match 
   your installation. 
   
7. Clear caches

   Clear all caches (from admin 'Setup' tab or from command line).

8. Incorporate the new classes in to your site

   A template has been provided to simplify integrating the calendar in to your site
   at blendcalendar/design/standard/templates/parts/calendar.tpl
   This template has been designed to be configurable for a wide number of uses via
   variables passed in when including it in a template. Examine the comments in the 
   template for further details.
